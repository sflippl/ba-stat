@article{Box1964,
abstract = {In the analysis of data it is often assumed that observations y1, y2, ..., yn are independently normally distributed with constant variance and with expectations specified by a model linear in a set of parameters $\theta$. In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homoscedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

@article{Chambers2014a,
abstract = {This paper reviews some programming techniques in R that have proved useful, particularly for substantial projects. These include several versions of object-oriented programming, used in a large number of R packages. The review tries to clarify the origins and ideas behind the various versions, each of which is valuable in the appropriate context. R has also been strongly influenced by the ideas of functional programming and, in particular, by the desire to combine functional with object oriented programming. To clarify how this particular mix of ideas has turned out in the current R language and supporting software, the paper will first review the basic ideas behind object-oriented and functional programming, and then examine the evolution of R with these ideas providing context. Functional programming supports well-defined, defensible software giving reproducible results. Object-oriented programming is the mechanism par excellence for managing complexity while keeping things simple for the user. The two paradigms have been valuable in supporting major software for fitting models to data and numerous other statistical applications. The paradigms have been adopted, and adapted, distinctively in R. Functional programming motivates much of R but R does not enforce the paradigm. Object-oriented programming from a functional perspective differs from that used in non-functional languages, a distinction that needs to be emphasized to avoid confusion. R initially replicated the S language from Bell Labs, which in turn was strongly influenced by earlier program libraries. At each stage, new ideas have been added, but the previous software continues to show its influence in the design as well. Outlining the evolution will further clarify why we currently have this somewhat unusual combination of ideas.},

@article{Alavi2001,
abstract = {Knowledge is a broad and abstract notion that has defined epistemological debate in western philosophy since the classical Greek era. In the past few years, however, there has been a growing interest in treating knowledge as a significant organizational resource. Consistent with the interest in organizational knowledge and knowledge management (KM), IS researchers have begun promoting a class of information systems, referred to as knowledge management systems (KMS). The objective of KMS is to support creation, transfer, and application of knowledge in organizations. Knowledge and knowledge management are complex and multi-faceted concepts. Thus, effective development and implementation of KMS requires a foundation in several rich literatures. To be credible, KMS research and development should preserve and build upon the significant literature that exists in different but rzelated fields. This paper provides a review and interpretation of knowledge management literatures in different fields with an eye toward identifying the important areas for research. We present a detailed process view of organizational knowledge management with a focus on the potential role of information technology in this process. Drawing upon the literature review and analysis of knowledge management processes, we discuss several important research issues surrounding the knowledge management processes and the role of IT in support of these processes.},

@article{Wickham2014,
abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},
annote = {Wickham introduces the concept of tidy data which underlies the tidyverse in R. It is an attempt to formulate his intuition regarding a subset of data cleaning he calls data tidying. He describes these operations with the plyr-package that is, as of today, outdated. The general thought process still applies: Observations are rows, variables are column, different kinds of observations are different tables. The ideas are inspired by Codd's relational algebra (1990) which I will look into next.},

@article{Weidmann2010,
abstract = {We describe CShapes, a new dataset that provides historical maps of state boundaries and capitals in the post-World War II period. The dataset is coded according to both the Correlates of War and the Gleditsch and Ward (1999) state lists, and is therefore compatible with a great number of existing databases in the discipline. Provided in a geographic data format, CShapes can be used directly with standard GIS software, allowing a wide range of spatial computations. In addition, we supply a CShapes package for the R statistical toolkit. This package enables researchers without GIS skills to per- form various useful operations on the GIS maps. The paper intro- duces the CShapes dataset and structure and gives three examples of how to use CShapes in political science research. First, we show how results from quantitative analysis can be depicted intuitively as a map. The second application gives an example of computing indicators on the CShapes maps, which can then be used in statis- tical tests. Third, we illustrate the use of CShapes for generating different weights matrices in spatial statistical applications. All the examples can be replicated using the freely available R package and do not require specialized GIS skills. The dataset is available for download from the CShapes website (http://nils.weidmann.ws/ projects/cshapes).},
