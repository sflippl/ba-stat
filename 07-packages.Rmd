# (APPENDIX) Appendix {-}

# Packages

This Bachelor's Thesis includes two packages: `tectr` and `vdem.tectr`. Both 
can be found on github:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sflippl/tectr")
devtools::install_github("sflippl/vdem.tectr")
```

As these repositories are going to change in the future (and for reasons of completeness), I have additionally included:

* Both built packages
* The zipped version of the RStudio projects.
